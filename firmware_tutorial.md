# Firmware Setup Tutorial

First, install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/).

<details>
<summary>What is Arduino IDE?</summary>

Arduino IDE is used to edit sketches and upload them to boards like the [ESP32-C6](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-c6) over USB.

## Step 1: Install the ESP32 Board Package

ESP32 support isn't included by default, so you need to add Espressif's board package URL.

1. Open the Arduino IDE.
2. Go to **File > Preferences** (or **Arduino IDE > Settings** on macOS).
3. In the **"Additional Boards Manager URLs"** field, add the following URL:
   ```
   https://espressif.github.io/arduino-esp32/package_esp32_index.json
   ```
   > **Note:** If you already have URLs here, separate entries with commas.
4. Click **OK** to save the preferences.
5. Wait for the board index to download.

<details>
<summary>Why this step?</summary>

This URL provides Arduino with Espressif's board definitions and the tools needed to compile and upload.

</details>

## Step 2: Install the Board in Boards Manager

1. Open the **Boards Manager** by navigating to **Tools > Board > Boards Manager**.
2. In the search bar, type `esp32`.
3. Locate the entry for **"esp32 by Espressif Systems"**.
4. Click the **Install** button.
   > **Important:** Ensure you are using version **3.0.0 or later**, which supports the C6.
5. Wait for the installation to finish.

<details>
<summary>What gets installed?</summary>

It installs the [RISC-V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V) cross-compiler toolchain, ESP-IDF libraries, and upload tools.

</details>

## Step 3: Select the Board and Port

1. After installation, go to **Tools > Board > esp32**.
2. Select your board model: `XIAO ESP32C6`.

<details>
<summary>Why does the board selection matter?</summary>

The selected board controls default pin mappings and build settings (flash size, bootloader, clock speed).

</details>

## Step 4: Install Required Libraries

In **Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries**, install:

1. **Adafruit SSD1306** (by Adafruit)
2. **Adafruit GFX Library** (by Adafruit), which will be prompted as a dependency.

<details>
<summary>What are these libraries for?</summary>

- **Adafruit SSD1306**: SSD1306 OLED driver (I2C).
- **Adafruit GFX**: drawing primitives used by the driver.

</details>

## Step 5: Create the Project

Create a new Arduino sketch: **File > New Sketch**, then save it as `Tamagotchi.ino`.

<details>
<summary>What is a .ino file?</summary>

Arduino treats `.ino` as C++. The IDE adds `Arduino.h` and generates `main()`, so sketches only need to implement [`setup()`](https://docs.arduino.cc/language-reference/en/structure/sketch/setup/) and [`loop()`](https://docs.arduino.cc/language-reference/en/structure/sketch/loop/).

</details>

---

## Step 6: Reading Your Schematic for Firmware

Before writing any code, open your `.kicad_sch` and confirm each component's connections to the MCU. Your pin mappings in firmware must match the schematic.

Trace each component to the MCU and record the GPIO number. KiCad shortcut: click a wire and press **`** (backtick) to highlight the net.

### My Results

Example pin mapping from my schematic (yours will differ):

**Buttons** (active-low: one side to GND, other side to MCU → reads `LOW` when pressed):

| Button | MCU Pin | GPIO |
|--------|---------|------|
| SW1 | Pin 1 | GPIO0 |
| SW2 | Pin 2 | GPIO1 |
| SW3 | Pin 3 | GPIO2 |

**OLED Display** (I²C address is usually `0x3C`, check your datasheet):

| OLED Pin | MCU Pin | GPIO |
|----------|---------|------|
| SDA | Pin 5 | GPIO22 |
| SCL | Pin 6 | GPIO23 |

**Buzzer** (positive terminal tied 3.3V to GPIO **sinks** current, so `LOW` = ON):

| Buzzer Pin | MCU Pin | GPIO |
|------------|---------|------|
| Signal | Pin 10 | GPIO20 |

<details>
<summary>How do I know if my buzzer is active or passive?</summary>

- **Active buzzer**: has an internal oscillator. Turn it on/off with a digital signal.
- **Passive buzzer**: requires a driven waveform. Control pitch with `tone()`.

Check the datasheet or distributor listing. Active buzzers typically mention an internal oscillator; passive ones don't.

</details>

### Turn Your Results into Code

Define the GPIOs at the top of your sketch:

```cpp
// Buttons (traced from schematic)
#define BTN1 0   // SW1 → MCU Pin 1 → GPIO0
#define BTN2 1   // SW2 → MCU Pin 2 → GPIO1
#define BTN3 2   // SW3 → MCU Pin 3 → GPIO2

// I2C OLED (traced from schematic)
#define SDA_PIN 22  // OLED SDA → MCU Pin 5 → GPIO22
#define SCL_PIN 23  // OLED SCL → MCU Pin 6 → GPIO23

// Buzzer (traced from schematic)
#define BUZZER 20   // Buzzer signal → MCU Pin 10 → GPIO20
```

Use the GPIO numbers from your schematic. If these `#define`s don't match your wiring, the firmware will compile but the hardware won't behave correctly.

---

## Step 7: Includes and Hardware Configuration

Add the required includes and configure the display and pin constants.

```cpp
#include <Wire.h>
#include <Adafruit_GFX.h>
#include <Adafruit_SSD1306.h>

#define SCREEN_WIDTH 128
#define SCREEN_HEIGHT 64
#define OLED_RESET -1

Adafruit_SSD1306 display(SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT, &Wire, OLED_RESET);

#define BTN_LEFT   D0
#define BTN_MIDDLE D1
#define BTN_RIGHT  D2
#define BUZZER_PIN D3
```

**Notes:**

- `#include <Wire.h>` includes the [I2C library](https://docs.arduino.cc/language-reference/en/functions/communication/wire/), which handles communication with the OLED over the SDA/SCL pins.
- `#include <Adafruit_GFX.h>` and `#include <Adafruit_SSD1306.h>` bring in the display driver and graphics functions.
- `SCREEN_WIDTH` / `SCREEN_HEIGHT` match the 0.96" OLED resolution (128x64 pixels).
- `OLED_RESET` is set to `-1` because our OLED does not have a dedicated reset pin.
- `Adafruit_SSD1306 display(...)` creates the display object we'll use to draw everything.
- `BTN_LEFT`, `BTN_MIDDLE`, `BTN_RIGHT` are the GPIO pins connected to the buttons. Set these to match your schematic.
- `BUZZER_PIN` is the GPIO connected to the buzzer.

<details>
<summary>What if my buttons are on different pins?</summary>

Check your KiCad schematic to see which GPIO pins your buttons are wired to. Then change `D0`, `D1`, `D2`, and `D3` to match. For example, if your left button is on pin D5, change the line to `#define BTN_LEFT D5`.

</details>

## Step 8: Define the Pet Model

Define a [`struct`](https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/structures/) to store the pet's stats.

```cpp
struct Pet {
  int hunger;       // 0 to 100 (0 = starving, 100 = full)
  int happiness;    // 0 to 100 (0 = miserable, 100 = ecstatic)
  int energy;       // 0 to 100 (0 = exhausted, 100 = fully rested)
  unsigned long age; // total seconds the pet has been alive
};
```

**Notes:**

- `struct Pet { ... };` defines a `Pet` type with fields for the pet's stats.
- `int hunger;` is an integer from 0 to 100. We chose `int` because the values are small whole numbers.
- `unsigned long age;` uses [`unsigned long`](https://docs.arduino.cc/language-reference/en/variables/data-types/unsignedLong/) (0 to 4,294,967,295) because time values from `millis()` can get very large and are never negative.

Create one global instance:

```cpp
Pet pet;
```

<details>
<summary>Why global?</summary>

A [global variable](https://docs.arduino.cc/language-reference/en/variables/variable-scope-qualifiers/scope/) lets `setup()`, `loop()`, and helpers share the same state.

</details>

## Step 9: Define UI States ([State Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine))

Define named states for the UI using a finite state machine. The program is always in exactly one state.

```cpp
enum Screen {
  SCREEN_MAIN,
  SCREEN_FEED,
  SCREEN_PLAY,
  SCREEN_SLEEP
};

Screen currentScreen = SCREEN_MAIN;
```

**Notes:**

- `enum Screen { ... };` is an [`enum`](https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/other_data_types/) (enumeration) that assigns human-readable names to integer constants. Under the hood, `SCREEN_MAIN` = 0, `SCREEN_FEED` = 1, etc., but we never need to know that.
- `Screen currentScreen = SCREEN_MAIN;` tracks which screen we're on right now. The program starts on the main screen.

<details>
<summary>Why use a state machine?</summary>

Without it, you end up with deeply nested `if` statements that are hard to read and debug. A state machine makes the logic predictable: *"When I'm in state X and event Y happens, go to state Z."* This is the same pattern used in [real embedded systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UML_state_machine), game engines, and protocol parsers.

</details>

## Step 10: Setup Function

[`setup()`](https://docs.arduino.cc/language-reference/en/structure/sketch/setup/) runs **once** when the board powers on or resets. Use it to initialize the display, buttons, and starting values.

```cpp
void setup() {
  pinMode(BTN_LEFT, INPUT_PULLUP);
  pinMode(BTN_MIDDLE, INPUT_PULLUP);
  pinMode(BTN_RIGHT, INPUT_PULLUP);
  pinMode(BUZZER_PIN, OUTPUT);

  display.begin(SSD1306_SWITCHCAPVCC, 0x3C);
  display.clearDisplay();
  display.setTextSize(1);
  display.setTextColor(SSD1306_WHITE);
  display.setCursor(0, 0);
  display.println("Tamagotchi Init...");
  display.display();
  delay(1000);

  pet.hunger = 80;
  pet.happiness = 80;
  pet.energy = 80;
  pet.age = 0;
}
```

**Notes:**

- `pinMode(BTN_LEFT, INPUT_PULLUP);` configures each button pin as an input with the [internal pull-up resistor](https://docs.arduino.cc/language-reference/en/functions/digital-io/pinMode/) enabled. This means the pin reads `HIGH` normally and `LOW` when the button is pressed (active-low).
- `pinMode(BUZZER_PIN, OUTPUT);` sets the buzzer pin as an output so we can drive it with a signal.
- `display.begin(SSD1306_SWITCHCAPVCC, 0x3C);` initializes the OLED. `0x3C` is the [I2C address](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-gfx-graphics-library) of the display (the most common address for these OLEDs).
- `display.clearDisplay();` clears any leftover data in the display buffer.
- `display.setTextSize(1);` sets text to the smallest size (6x8 pixels per character).
- `display.setTextColor(SSD1306_WHITE);` sets the drawing color to white (lit pixels).
- `display.println(...)` writes text to the **buffer** (not the screen yet).
- `display.display();` pushes the buffer to the actual OLED screen. **You must call this for anything to appear!**
- Stats start at 80/100, leaving room for improvement or decay.

<details>
<summary>What if my OLED doesn't turn on?</summary>

The most common issues are:
- **Wrong I2C address**: Some OLEDs use `0x3D` instead of `0x3C`. Try changing the address in `display.begin()`.
- **Wiring**: Double-check that SDA, SCL, VCC (3V3), and GND are connected correctly.
- **Library not installed**: Make sure you installed both Adafruit SSD1306 and Adafruit GFX.

</details>

## Step 11: Game Update Logic

Stats decay over time using [`millis()`](https://docs.arduino.cc/language-reference/en/functions/time/millis/) instead of [`delay()`](https://docs.arduino.cc/language-reference/en/functions/time/delay/). `delay()` blocks the entire program; `millis()` lets input and rendering continue.

```cpp
unsigned long lastUpdate = 0;

void updatePet() {
  if (millis() - lastUpdate > 5000) {  // every 5 seconds
    pet.hunger--;
    pet.happiness--;
    pet.energy--;

    if (pet.hunger < 0) pet.hunger = 0;
    if (pet.happiness < 0) pet.happiness = 0;
    if (pet.energy < 0) pet.energy = 0;

    pet.age += 5;
    lastUpdate = millis();
  }
}
```

**Notes:**

- `unsigned long lastUpdate = 0;` remembers the last time we updated the pet. Starts at 0 (boot time).
- `millis() - lastUpdate > 5000` checks if more than 5000ms (5 seconds) have passed. `millis()` returns the number of milliseconds since the board powered on.
- `pet.hunger--` uses the [`--` operator](https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/operators/) to decrement by 1. Every 5 seconds, the pet gets slightly hungrier, sadder, and more tired.
- `if (pet.hunger < 0) pet.hunger = 0;` is **clamping**: we prevent stats from going below zero. Without this, hunger could hit -50, which makes no sense.
- `lastUpdate = millis();` resets the timer so the next update happens 5 seconds from *now*.

<details>
<summary>What is non-blocking timing?</summary>

This `millis()` pattern is fundamental to embedded programming. It's how you schedule periodic tasks without blocking the CPU. You'll see this exact pattern in [Arduino's BlinkWithoutDelay example](https://docs.arduino.cc/built-in-examples/digital/BlinkWithoutDelay/).

</details>

## Step 12: Reading Button Input

The buttons are wired active-low. Read them with [`digitalRead()`](https://docs.arduino.cc/language-reference/en/functions/digital-io/digitalRead/) and debounce to prevent repeated triggers.

```cpp
unsigned long lastButtonPress = 0;

void checkButtons() {
  if (millis() - lastButtonPress < 200) return;  // debounce: ignore presses within 200ms

  if (digitalRead(BTN_LEFT) == LOW) {
    currentScreen = SCREEN_FEED;
    tone(BUZZER_PIN, 1000, 50);
    lastButtonPress = millis();
  }
  else if (digitalRead(BTN_MIDDLE) == LOW) {
    currentScreen = SCREEN_PLAY;
    tone(BUZZER_PIN, 1200, 50);
    lastButtonPress = millis();
  }
  else if (digitalRead(BTN_RIGHT) == LOW) {
    currentScreen = SCREEN_SLEEP;
    tone(BUZZER_PIN, 800, 50);
    lastButtonPress = millis();
  }
}
```

**Notes:**

- `unsigned long lastButtonPress = 0;` tracks the last time any button was pressed, used for debouncing.
- `if (millis() - lastButtonPress < 200) return;` is **debouncing**. Physical buttons "bounce" (make and break contact rapidly) when pressed, which can register as multiple presses. By ignoring any press within 200ms of the last one, we ensure one press = one action.
- `digitalRead(BTN_LEFT) == LOW` reads the pin state. Because the buttons are active-low, `LOW` means the button is currently being pressed.
- `currentScreen = SCREEN_FEED;` sets the state but doesn't act on it. The actual logic runs in Step 13, keeping input detection and action execution separate.
- [`tone(BUZZER_PIN, 1000, 50);`](https://docs.arduino.cc/language-reference/en/functions/advanced-io/tone/) plays a short beep (1000Hz for 50ms) as audible feedback.

<details>
<summary>What is debouncing?</summary>

When you press a button, the contacts bounce for a few milliseconds, creating rapid on/off signals. The 200ms cooldown timer filters these out so one press registers once.

</details>

**Button mapping:**

| Button | Action | State Transition |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Left | Feed the pet | → `SCREEN_FEED` |
| Middle | Play with pet | → `SCREEN_PLAY` |
| Right | Put pet to sleep | → `SCREEN_SLEEP` |

## Step 13: Screen Logic

Each screen modifies the pet's stats and returns to the main screen. Actions are one-shot: press feed, hunger goes up, done.

```cpp
void handleScreenLogic() {
  switch(currentScreen) {

    case SCREEN_FEED:
      pet.hunger += 10;
      if (pet.hunger > 100) pet.hunger = 100;
      currentScreen = SCREEN_MAIN;
      break;

    case SCREEN_PLAY:
      pet.happiness += 10;
      pet.energy -= 5;
      if (pet.happiness > 100) pet.happiness = 100;
      if (pet.energy < 0) pet.energy = 0;
      currentScreen = SCREEN_MAIN;
      break;

    case SCREEN_SLEEP:
      pet.energy += 15;
      if (pet.energy > 100) pet.energy = 100;
      currentScreen = SCREEN_MAIN;
      break;

    case SCREEN_MAIN:
      break;  // do nothing, just display stats
  }
}
```

**Notes:**

- [`switch(currentScreen)`](https://docs.arduino.cc/language-reference/en/structure/control-structure/switchCase/) selects behavior based on the current UI state.
- `pet.hunger += 10;` uses the [`+=` operator](https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/operators/) to add 10 to the current value. Feeding restores 10 hunger points.
- `if (pet.hunger > 100) pet.hunger = 100;` is **upper clamping**: stats can't exceed 100. This is the mirror of the lower clamping in `updatePet()`.
- `pet.energy -= 5;`: playing increases happiness but costs energy.
- `currentScreen = SCREEN_MAIN;` returns to main after the action completes. This makes each action a one-shot: the player must actively choose to do something again.
- Each `case` ends with [`break`](https://docs.arduino.cc/language-reference/en/structure/control-structure/break/) to prevent fall-through.

<details>
<summary>Why does SCREEN_MAIN do nothing?</summary>

`SCREEN_MAIN` only renders stats; actions happen in the other states.

</details>

## Step 14: Pet Sprites

Create 1-bit sprites for the pet using [draw-to-bit](https://draw-to-bit.vercel.app/), which exports pixel art as C byte arrays.

You need at least a few expressions so the sprite reflects the pet's stats. Example 16x16 sprites:

```cpp
// Example: Happy face (all stats above 50)
const unsigned char PROGMEM petHappy[] = {
  0b00000000, 0b00000000,
  0b00011111, 0b11111000,
  0b00100000, 0b00000100,
  0b01000000, 0b00000010,
  0b01001100, 0b00110010,
  0b01001100, 0b00110010,
  0b01000000, 0b00000010,
  0b01000000, 0b00000010,
  0b01000100, 0b00100010,
  0b01000011, 0b11000010,
  0b01000000, 0b00000010,
  0b00100000, 0b00000100,
  0b00011111, 0b11111000,
  0b00000000, 0b00000000,
  0b00000000, 0b00000000,
  0b00000000, 0b00000000
};

// Example: Sad face (any stat below 30)
const unsigned char PROGMEM petSad[] = {
  0b00000000, 0b00000000,
  0b00011111, 0b11111000,
  0b00100000, 0b00000100,
  0b01000000, 0b00000010,
  0b01001100, 0b00110010,
  0b01001100, 0b00110010,
  0b01000000, 0b00000010,
  0b01000000, 0b00000010,
  0b01000000, 0b00000010,
  0b01000011, 0b11000010,
  0b01000100, 0b00100010,
  0b00100000, 0b00000100,
  0b00011111, 0b11111000,
  0b00000000, 0b00000000,
  0b00000000, 0b00000000,
  0b00000000, 0b00000000
};

// Example: Neutral face (everything else)
const unsigned char PROGMEM petNeutral[] = {
  0b00000000, 0b00000000,
  0b00011111, 0b11111000,
  0b00100000, 0b00000100,
  0b01000000, 0b00000010,
  0b01001100, 0b00110010,
  0b01001100, 0b00110010,
  0b01000000, 0b00000010,
  0b01000000, 0b00000010,
  0b01000111, 0b11100010,
  0b01000000, 0b00000010,
  0b01000000, 0b00000010,
  0b00100000, 0b00000100,
  0b00011111, 0b11111000,
  0b00000000, 0b00000000,
  0b00000000, 0b00000000,
  0b00000000, 0b00000000
};

// Example: Sleeping face (closed eyes)
const unsigned char PROGMEM petSleep[] = {
  0b00000000, 0b00000000,
  0b00011111, 0b11111000,
  0b00100000, 0b00000100,
  0b01000000, 0b00000010,
  0b01001111, 0b01110010,
  0b01000000, 0b00000010,
  0b01000000, 0b00000010,
  0b01000000, 0b00000010,
  0b01000011, 0b11000010,
  0b01000000, 0b00000010,
  0b01000000, 0b00000010,
  0b00100000, 0b00000100,
  0b00011111, 0b11111000,
  0b00000000, 0b00000000,
  0b00000000, 0b00000000,
  0b00000000, 0b00000000
};
```

**Notes:**

- `const unsigned char PROGMEM` stores the bitmap in flash instead of RAM. See [`PROGMEM`](https://docs.arduino.cc/language-reference/en/variables/utilities/PROGMEM/).
- Each row is two bytes (16 bits = 16 pixels wide). A `1` bit lights up that pixel, a `0` bit leaves it dark.
- Four example expressions are defined above. Replace them with your own sprites from [draw-to-bit](https://draw-to-bit.vercel.app/).

<details>
<summary>Can I make the pet sprite bigger?</summary>

Yes. Use a larger bitmap (e.g., 32x32) and update the `drawBitmap()` dimensions to match. Larger sprites use more flash and screen space.

</details>

## Step 15: Display Function (OLED Rendering)

Draws the sprite and stat bars. Sprite selection is based on current stats.

```cpp
void render() {
  display.clearDisplay();

  // Choose the right sprite based on pet stats
  const unsigned char* sprite;
  if (pet.hunger < 30 || pet.happiness < 30 || pet.energy < 30) {
    sprite = petSad;
  } else if (pet.hunger > 50 && pet.happiness > 50 && pet.energy > 50) {
    sprite = petHappy;
  } else {
    sprite = petNeutral;
  }

  // Draw the pet sprite (centered horizontally, near the top)
  display.drawBitmap(56, 2, sprite, 16, 16, SSD1306_WHITE);

  // Draw stat bars below the pet
  display.setTextSize(1);

  display.setCursor(0, 24);
  display.print("HUN ");
  drawBar(24, 24, pet.hunger);

  display.setCursor(0, 34);
  display.print("HAP ");
  drawBar(24, 34, pet.happiness);

  display.setCursor(0, 44);
  display.print("ENG ");
  drawBar(24, 44, pet.energy);

  // Button labels at the bottom
  display.setCursor(0, 56);
  display.println("[Feed] [Play] [Sleep]");

  display.display();
}

// Draws a stat bar: empty rectangle with a filled portion based on value (0 to 100)
void drawBar(int x, int y, int value) {
  int barWidth = 100;
  int barHeight = 6;
  int fillWidth = map(value, 0, 100, 0, barWidth);

  display.drawRect(x, y, barWidth, barHeight, SSD1306_WHITE);       // outline
  display.fillRect(x, y, fillWidth, barHeight, SSD1306_WHITE);      // filled portion
}
```

**Notes:**

- Sprite is chosen by `if/else`: any stat below 30 = sad, all above 50 = happy, otherwise neutral.
- [`display.drawBitmap()`](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-gfx-graphics-library/graphics-primitives) draws a 1-bit bitmap. `56, 2` centers the 16px sprite on the 128px-wide screen.
- `drawBar()` draws an outline with [`drawRect()`](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-gfx-graphics-library/graphics-primitives) and fills it proportionally with `fillRect()`.
- [`map()`](https://docs.arduino.cc/language-reference/en/functions/math/map/) scales the stat value to the bar's pixel width.
- `display.display()` pushes the buffer to the OLED.

<summary>Why do we clear and redraw every frame?</summary>

The SSD1306 uses a framebuffer. Without clearing first, old pixels remain and overlap new content. The clear → draw → display pattern is standard for frame-based rendering.

## Step 16: Main Loop

[`loop()`](https://docs.arduino.cc/language-reference/en/structure/sketch/loop/) runs repeatedly after `setup()` finishes. It reads input, updates state, and redraws the display.

```cpp
void loop() {
  checkButtons();       // 1. Read input
  updatePet();          // 2. Update state over time
  handleScreenLogic();  // 3. Process actions
  render();             // 4. Display results
  delay(100);           // 5. Short pause
}
```

**Loop order:**

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    GAME LOOP                         │
│                                                      │
│  ┌─────────┐   ┌────────┐   ┌───────┐   ┌────────┐ │
│  │  INPUT   │──▶│ UPDATE │──▶│ LOGIC │──▶│ RENDER │ │
│  │ (read    │   │ (decay │   │ (feed,│   │ (draw  │ │
│  │ buttons) │   │ stats) │   │ play) │   │ OLED)  │ │
│  └─────────┘   └────────┘   └───────┘   └────────┘ │
│       ▲                                      │      │
│       └──────────── delay(100) ──────────────┘      │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

1. **Input**: Read buttons, set `currentScreen`.
2. **Update**: Decay stats based on elapsed time.
3. **Logic**: Execute the selected action (feed/play/sleep), return to main.
4. **Render**: Draw the frame.
5. **Pause**: `delay(100)` limits refresh rate while keeping input responsive.

<summary>What is a game loop?</summary>

This is a standard [game loop](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/game-loop.html) pattern (input → update → render), common in interactive programs.
