## Creating the Schematic

> Note: Your schematic should NOT look like this at the end of the tutorial! You are required to add your own components, and switch it up to personalize it :D 

The XIAO-ESP32-C6 will be used as the MCU! This is because it’s tiny and  includes WiFi, Bluetooth, and built‑in battery charging, which makes it perfect for this.

First, I imported the XIAO-ESP32-C6 from [OPL Library](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/OPL_Kicad_Library/tree/master). Heres an [excellent tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnCvyGIQong) on using it! 

<!-- I will create my own video later, which may be easier to use, if trouble is reported undestanding it. I think beginners may struggle. -->

I then click A, search for the part, and import it. 

I ended up with this!

Now, for this tutorial I will create the base tamagotchi. Spice your own tamagotchi up more then this one! Add some flavor!

I then added the [0.96 OLED](https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/C5248080.html) via EasyEDA to KiCAD. Follow this [guide](https://hwdocs.hackclub.dev/user-contrib-guides/easyeda2kicad/)!
