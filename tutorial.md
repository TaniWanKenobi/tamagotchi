## Creating the Schematic

The XIAO-ESP32-C6 will be used as the MCU! This is because it's tiny and includes WiFi, Bluetooth, and built‑in battery charging, which makes it perfect for this.

### Importing the MCU

First, I imported the XIAO-ESP32-C6 from the [OPL Library](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/OPL_Kicad_Library/tree/master). Here's an [excellent tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnCvyGIQong) on using it!

<!-- I will create my own video later, which may be easier to use, if trouble is reported understanding it. I think beginners may struggle. -->

I then clicked **A**, searched for the part, and imported it. I ended up with this:

![Xiao](https://cdn.hackclub.com/019c53e5-ec14-7422-a389-020a03b09210/41a97672-ab63-43bd-876a-20fb04e2273d.png)

Now, for this tutorial, I will create the base Tamagotchi. Spice your own Tamagotchi up more than this one! Add some flavor!

### Adding the OLED Display

I then added the [0.96" OLED](https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/C5248080.html) via EasyEDA to KiCad. Follow this [guide](https://hwdocs.hackclub.dev/user-contrib-guides/easyeda2kicad/)!

I connected GND to GND, SDA to SDA, and SCL to SCL.

> Normally you need pull‑up resistors on SDA and SCL, but the XIAO boards already include internal pull‑ups, so you don't need external ones here.

I checked the [datasheet](https://www.lcsc.com/datasheet/C5248080.pdf) attached on the LCSC page and found that VCC should be connected to 3V3.

![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15b279c4-acc2-40db-b04b-2e664e778855)

### Adding Buttons

Since a Tamagotchi has three buttons, I decided to add those as well!

For this, I decided to use an **active‑low** button layout (which is the most common approach).

Each button connects one side to **GND** and the other to a **GPIO pin** with the XIAO's **internal pull‑up** enabled. This makes the pin read **HIGH** when the button is idle, and **LOW** when the button is pressed.

### Adding a Buzzer

I also added a buzzer from [here](https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/C49246964.html)!

The buzzer is wired with one pin to a GPIO output and the other to GND, letting the GPIO drive it with a square‑wave tone.

![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68f89dc9-19ea-4992-93f8-83674963e40d)

### Assigning Footprints

This is my final schematic! Let's make the PCB now. First, let's assign parts. Click this:

![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7fdab501-5c92-4df0-b032-ab40fdc7018a)

Then assign the corresponding EasyEDA / OPL parts! For the buttons, import from [here](https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/C2888493.html)!

![Footprint assignment](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cbc73d30-a61e-4a5a-912f-915604c71418)

Now, press this and open the PCB viewer:

![Open PCB viewer](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5bbc50fa-dbe2-4ab1-b301-5c360a974529)

## Creating the PCB

**The maximum size of your PCB should be 100mm²!**

You should see something like this:

![PCB editor](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1cf53978-42d2-49b6-ab12-837e863fc6ed)

To synchronize changes between your schematic and PCB layout in KiCad:

- Press **F8**, *or*
- Click the **Update PCB from Schematic** button

You can do this anytime you want to refresh the PCB with the latest schematic updates.

### Laying Out Components

First, I laid my PCB out in a 100×100 box. I then laid out all my components:

![Component layout](https://cdn.hackclub.com/019c545b-804f-7cba-a7bb-06a9ee3376d9/image.png)

### Defining the Board Outline

You'll notice a white outline surrounding the entire board. This is the **Edge Cuts** layer, which defines the physical boundary where the PCB will be cut.

This is done by modifying the `Edge.Cuts` layer on the right side. There are many ways to do this — you can manually draw it with the given menu.

I found the default outline options limiting and wanted to create something more complex. To do this, I:

1. Drew out the edge cuts layer.
2. Converted the image into a DXF file using an image-to-DXF converter.
3. Imported the DXF file into KiCad.
4. Created a 100×100 mm box as a reference.
5. Used the measuring tool to determine the correct scale.
6. Scaled the outline down so it fit within 100 mm.

## PCB Routing

A PCB is made up of multiple layers. Our boards are "two-layer," meaning that they have two layers of copper wire.

The layers include:

| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Top & bottom silkscreen** | The white ink layer where you can add art |
| **Top & bottom copper** | The layers where you make your copper wires |
| **Substrate** | The actual plastic (usually green) which makes up your board |
| **Via** | The tunnels which connect the top and bottom copper layers |

![PCB layers](https://cdn.hackclub.com/019c545f-32f8-71b8-9b46-079aee118944/c2ec73f247fdb1f466903fc86d345fe0f4b47b6f_image.webp)

### Placing Components

Place all of your components inside the board outline. Move components to shorten **ratlines**, which are the straight blue lines.

- Use **R** to rotate components
- Remember to save (**Ctrl+S** / **⌘+S**) often!

### Routing Traces

Now it's time to route the PCB! Hit **X** on your keyboard and click anything with a thin blue line poking out of it. It should dim the entire screen, show you which direction you need to go with a thin blue line, and highlight the destination:

![Routing example](https://cdn.hackclub.com/019c5460-5bb4-737a-8875-2d15ef8f3715/image.png)

Join the highlighted points together. If there isn't enough space on the front side, or there is a trace already present that is blocking you, you can route on the back side by clicking **B.Cu** on the right toolbar. If you want to change sides during routing, press **V** and a via will be added, which will transfer your trace to the other side of the board.

> **Important:** Wires and pads of different colors (except golden) can't be connected together directly! You must use a via to the other side.

![Routing complete](/old-cdn/94a3f8fd9531b47e0f5322ea7bf1c76724ad1c82_image.webp)

Your routing is complete!

> **Tip:** Place everything based on what shortens the blue lines, and what makes them not cross!

> **Tip:** Use a [ground plane](https://www.kicadtips.com/how-to/make-a-ground-plane) to help with routing and to reduce noise. That's what the red and blue layers are for! It's not necessary, but looks nice and is easy to set up!

![Ground plane](https://cdn.hackclub.com/019c5461-63bf-785e-915e-34c92be3fb2b/image.png)

### Stitching Vias

I added [stitching vias](https://resources.altium.com/p/everything-you-need-know-about-stitching-vias) to the ground layer. These are small plated holes that connect the ground plane on one layer to the ground plane on another, improving shielding and reducing noise. They aren't strictly required for a simple board like this, but I included them to practice good grounding habits and to make the design a bit more robust.

![Stitching vias](https://cdn.hackclub.com/019c546b-8acc-7d6c-9c2b-b1a579d315ef/image.png)

## Customization

You may have already added some text and art to customize your board like me. If not, you can click **F.Silkscreen** and use the text tool.

![Sample text](https://cdn.hackclub.com/019c546c-c7b1-7df9-b96b-68dae071b550/image.png)

To add art, select the **Top Silkscreen Layer** or **Bottom Silkscreen Layer** in the sidebars, then use the KiCad image converter to add custom art.

![KiCad image converter](https://kicad-info.s3.dualstack.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/original/3X/a/3/a3b5fba9b9455697b0d861d48a028c571ec44403.png)

Your board is now beautiful! 🎨

## Run Design Rules Check

**DRC** stands for **Design Rules Check**. This runs a check that makes sure your board has no interference errors, no components are off the board, and no wires are intersecting. It does **not**, however, confirm that your board works.

![DRC](https://cdn.hackclub.com/019c5876-0777-7c3f-9817-931007221588/27ae0765082623ea2988bbe01ce8cb8a4012b0b8_image.webp)

Using the output, correct any errors. This can be confusing, so remember: you can always ask for help!

### Common DRC Errors

- **Track and copper errors** : clearance violations, track width, annular rings
- **Via errors** : diameter, micro vias, blind/buried vias
- **Pad and footprint errors** : pad-to-pad, hole clearances
- **Edge and board outline errors** : copper edge clearance, silkscreen issues
- **Zone errors** : copper slivers, starved thermals, unconnected items
- **Net and connection errors** : missing connections, net conflicts
- **Courtyard errors** : overlaps, missing courtyards

Once your PCB passes the DRC, it is finished!

In the PCB editor, click **View → 3D Viewer** to see your finished work!

![3D Viewer](https://cdn.hackclub.com/019c5472-6d23-70be-b813-a9eb320bb4e3/image.png)

### Late Additions

There will be moments when you realize you want to add something after you've done most of the work. That's totally fine!

Here, I decided to add battery functionality. Since the XIAO's underside pins are extremely difficult to solder, I designed the board so those pins connect to a pad instead. The battery can then plug into a set of male pins that interface with that pad. Here's what it looks like:

![Battery schematic](https://cdn.hackclub.com/019c5518-d617-7c27-b74c-7047a566dc60/image.png)

Here's my final schematic:

## Getting a JLCPCB Price

Go to [jlcpcb.com](https://jlcpcb.com/) and make an account. Then, add your Gerber file for the instant quote.

![JLCPCB upload](https://cdn.hackclub.com/019c5535-24e8-75f6-b7c0-adec3e312dc5/baaa0ca887d51110c30cba9d862968acbef618f8_image.webp)

### Settings

You should keep the default settings for everything. The only thing you should/can change is the **PCB Color**. I did black as seen below:

![PCB color](https://cdn.hackclub.com/019c5535-26c4-788a-8508-d053d383fd8d/2b2ea8e606d05ddff382fdcc7934da4bff70615c_image.webp)

For high-spec options, also keep the default. **Do not** click PCB assembly — we will give you a kit to hand-solder your board.

![High-spec options](https://cdn.hackclub.com/019c5535-28a4-787e-8bf4-ba4fcbce1653/053061912ca84c66c46323ccef5b12cb71c7d721_image.webp)

Once you have successfully *not* changed any of the settings (except the board color), on the right, change the shipping method to **Global Standard Direct** (or **Air Registered Mail** if it is cheaper), and take a screenshot (this is very important).

![Shipping](https://cdn.hackclub.com/019c5535-2ab1-7ba1-aa97-7d7a87e4203a/6f538d5f301eae997544c43c1d6ce6daca01331d_image.webp)

## Designing the Case

Export the PCB from KiCad into your CAD platform! For me, this is Onshape.

I googled and found headers! I found this from [here](https://www.3dcontentcentral.com/download-model.aspx?catalogid=171&id=1025256)!

I then experimented with the CAD a lot. I used revolve, but it did not look nice and was hard to use. I also tried multiple placements for the battery and found it was optimal if it's placed vertically.

To make these, I created a sketch by clicking the sketch button in the upper-left-hand side and made multiple shapes that include tolerance and my shell size.

![](https://cdn.hackclub.com/019c5c8f-7d48-7dc5-9f80-8dcef93f84e0/image.png)

![](https://cdn.hackclub.com/019c5985-794b-78d8-bbec-b885edabe178/image.png)

![](https://cdn.hackclub.com/019c5983-207f-747f-b33a-d92806aac17e/image.png)

I also decided to change the PCB to add the vibration motor to the back and raise the screen!

From

![](https://cdn.hackclub.com/019c59d1-a434-7b99-a5bf-7d486ab388f6/image.png)

to

![](https://cdn.hackclub.com/019c59cf-3ea1-7c97-8367-5ef8e0558b2a/image.png)

My headers overlapped with the buzzer, so I decided to reposition the buzzer to the middle of the board! The gap between the LCD and the headers should give me enough space!

![example](https://cdn.hackclub.com/019c5a0c-fc35-7127-b439-55fb132f13c3/image.png)

I made the back portion with 3D-printed standoffs and added large fillets to round the edges. I made the top part and added some tolerance between the top of the plate and the bottom of the top half of the case!

![](https://cdn.hackclub.com/019c5c85-9499-7b71-b5ed-3d3325909b62/image.png)

I added a hole for the battery and a hole for the USB-C. Generally, there may be issues printing this, but for this small amount of bridging there shouldn't be any issues!

![](https://cdn.hackclub.com/019c5c85-ee74-7721-ab42-03937224ebe6/image.png)

![](https://cdn.hackclub.com/019c5c87-d8d2-7de5-bc94-b7690c845c4c/image.png)

Finally, I used the section view tool to confirm that there is no overlapping:

![](https://cdn.hackclub.com/019c5c89-1791-78d6-9b35-902744dcb72a/image.png)

Now, my design is finished! I uploaded all necessary files to my GitHub repo.

**Note: Design is an iterative process. I spent about 20 hours manually adjusting everything to look as pretty as possible! But don't worry — #fallout is here to guide you! This is a normal process and you are not alone.**

I recommend **not** following the above 1:1; this was my process, and it will differ greatly from yours!

I also recommend checking my [Onshape](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/fa5791d8e7f345b436054923/w/ad8e09905eb572b0a8a40e9d/e/e81f06aa82a76dd04f8e6832?renderMode=0&uiState=6990af61d8ec4667253f72ea) for inspiration! Check my feature tree and see my iterations yourself.

Enjoy making :D!
